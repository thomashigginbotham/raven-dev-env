# Raven Development Environment

The technologies used for front-end web development are growing increasingly complex, and creating an environment that efficiently handles those tasks is a problem in itself.

Raven Development Environment makes this setup easy and provides a simple, flexible workflow. Here&rsquo;s what you get:

* A local web server with LiveReload support
* On-the-fly Sass compilation
* Move common HTML into separate files and import them as needed
* Minify CSS and JavaScript, and compress images
* Use source maps to debug minified code

## Prerequisites

You will need Node.js for most of the features to work. No worries, though â€” installation is easy. Just [download](https://nodejs.org/) and run the installer.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or [download a ZIP file](https://github.com/thomashigginbotham/raven-dev-env/archive/master.zip).
2. From a command line, change to the directory where you saved your files.
3. Run: `npm install`
